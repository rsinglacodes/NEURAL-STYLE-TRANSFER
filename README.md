📘 Project Overview

This project is part of my CODTECH Internship (Task 3) and focuses on implementing a Neural Style Transfer (NST) model that applies artistic styles to photographs. The goal is to combine the content of one image with the style of another, creating stunning artwork-like outputs using deep learning.

Neural Style Transfer uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract high-level features from images and blend them in a visually appealing way. This project demonstrates how AI can be used for creative and artistic applications.

🧠 Key Concepts

Neural Style Transfer (NST): A deep learning technique that merges two images — one for content and one for style.
Content Image: The base image whose structure is retained.
Style Image: The artistic image whose patterns, textures, and colors are extracted.
Output Image: A blend of the content and style images.

🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

Python
TensorFlow / PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL (Python Imaging Library)

⚙️ How It Works

Load and preprocess the content and style images.
Extract features from both images using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG19).
Define loss functions for content and style representation.
Optimize a generated image to minimize the combined loss.
Save and visualize the final stylized image.

#EXAMPLE

Content Image	:-<img width="800" height="601" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b207b15-4d02-4e18-abed-3cf233f7c221" />

Style Image	:-<img width="1160" height="934" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412bddfe-f177-4a6d-8269-4aacf3add344" />
